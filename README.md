# Martian Mines ROS2

Workflow:
1) Create new branch fork from develop branch with problem name,
2) solve problem,
3) create pull request to develop. 

### Requirements
- **Docker** (Docker CLI recommended)
  - Add your user to the Docker group to grant the necessary permissions; otherwise, you must prefix commands with sudo.
  
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended) with the following extensions:
  - [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
  - [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Docker build
```bash
docker build -t highflyers/martian_mines_ros2:latest . --build-arg USER_UID=$(id -u)
```

### Run for development
Running docker with GPU support requires [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html), but if you don't have NVIDIA GPU, you can remove the `--gpus=all` flag in `devcontainer.json` and run this container only with CPU.

Open repository in vscode:
```bash
cd /path/to/martian_mines_ros2/
code .
```
Click `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`. 
This will open the repository in the container and you can start developing.

To rebuild workspace use shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+B` in the vscode.


## Running the Mission in Simulation
To run the mission in simulation, ensure that both the simulation and mission containers share the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID.

Start the Simulation Container:
Launch the simulation container using the appropriate command described in the uav_sim_ros2 repository.

Wait for Gazebo and QGroundControl:
Ensure both Gazebo and QGC are running properly.

Launch the Mission:
In a separate terminal, run the mission launch command:
```bash
ros2 launch martian_mines mission.launch.py
```

## Running the Mission on Real Hardware (Jetson)
To run the mission on the Jetson, youâ€™ll need three terminal sessions using the same Docker image (one for the mission, one for MicroXRCE-DDS, and one to start the mission).

Step 1: Start the Docker Container
Use the following command to start the container:
```bash
docker run --network=host --ipc=host \
  --device=/dev/ttyACM0 --group-add dialout \
  --volume /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --privileged \
  -it martian-mines-ros2-system /bin/bash
```
### Note:
The flags --device=/dev/ttyACM0 and --group-add dialout are only needed for the container running the MicroXRCE-DDS agent.
The serial device (/dev/ttyACM0) may change on reboot, so verify the correct device each time. If you switch from a USB-UART converter to Jetson's native UART pins, the device path may also change.

Ensure you're using the martian-mines-ros2-system container, which is the latest version built on the Jetson. If unsure, rebuild the system with your preferred container name.

Also verify ROS_DOMAIN_ID in each container if running in seperate once.

### Step 2: Run the MicroXRCE-DDS Agent
In the first terminal, run:
```bash
MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
```
Adjust the --dev flag if your serial device path differs.

### Step 3: Build and Launch the System
In the second terminal:

Navigate to the martian_mines_ros2 workspace:
```bash
cd ~/ws/src/martian_mines_ros2/
```

Build the system packages:
```bash
source ./scripts/build.sh ../..
```

Source the workspace:
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

Launch the mission in real-world mode:
```bash
ros2 launch martian_mines mission.launch.py real_world:=True
```

### Step 4: Start the Mission
In the third terminal, run the following command to start the mission:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /mission_start std_msgs/Empty "{}"
```
Once everything is running, you should observe the drone arming and mission-related status messages printed in the terminal.

### TO DO  List
- Launches
  - [x] core.launch 
  - [ ] example_precison_landing.launch 
  - [x] example_trajectory_tracker.launch 
  - [x] figure_finder.launch.py
  - [x] figures_vis.launch
  - [x] mission.launch 
  - [ ] realsense.launch 
  - [ ] rosbag_play.launch 
  - [ ] rosbag_record.launch 
  - [ ] rviz.launch 

### Throubleshoting
If you will encounter a problem with "xcb" (GUI applications won't open) just run `xhost +local:docker` on your host machine.
