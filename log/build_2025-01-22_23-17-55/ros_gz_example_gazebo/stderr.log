[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz-common5.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gz-common5", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz-common5" with
  any of the following names:

    gz-common5Config.cmake
    gz-common5-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz-common5" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz-common5_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz-common5" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
